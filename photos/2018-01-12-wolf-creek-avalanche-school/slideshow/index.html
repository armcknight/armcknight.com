So, I've been looking into more backcountry type trips, and since we're staying in Colorado for the winter, it's a perfect opportunity to practice and meet people who can teach me a thing or two. Towards that end, I took the 3-day AIARE I Avalanche Course at Wolf Creek Avalanche School in the southern San Juan mountains, a place reknowned not only for its snowfall, but for its dangerous conditions. It was an eye opening experience that leaves me looking at the snow in a completely new and more respectful way." %}
