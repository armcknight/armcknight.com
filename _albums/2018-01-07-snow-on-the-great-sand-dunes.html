name: "Snowy Sand Dunes"
description: "On our third trip to the Great Sand Dunes National Park, we were delightfully surprised with a nice coat of snow on the ground, and a spectacular sunrise to boot. By the time we climbed up Star Dune, the highest sand dune in North America, the snow had largely disappeared."
