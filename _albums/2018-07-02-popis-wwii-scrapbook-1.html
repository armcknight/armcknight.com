name: "Popi's WWII Scrapbook I"
description: "A scrapbook of newspaper clippings kept by my grandparents during World War II. Not sure yet of the origins of the clippings or whether they were collected by my grandmother or grandfather, who was on deployment at times during the conflict. The clippings are fragile and starting to peel off their backing, so hopefully this digital archive preserves them. One of two scrapbooks."
