Sources also unknown, they could be from a military publication or a civilian publisher. The scrapbook is in poor shape, so I wanted to digitize it before it went any further. It's been sitting in a zipped Trapper Keeper at the bottom of a foot locker (also his from military) for the last 15 or so years, so I'm happy to be able to share it here now as it is an interesting vignette of the times."/>
