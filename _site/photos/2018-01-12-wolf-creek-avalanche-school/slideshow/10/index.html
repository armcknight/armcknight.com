		<meta name="description" content="Over the past few years visiting resorts in Colorado, I find myself enjoying the hike-to terrain the most gratifying experiences and rides. So, I've been looking into more backcountry type trips, and since we're staying in Colorado for the winter, it's a perfect opportunity to practice and meet people who can teach me a thing or two. Towards that end, I took the AIARE I Avalanche Course at Wolf Creek Avalanche School in the southern San Juan mountains, in a place reknownedd not only for its snowfall, but for its dangerous avalanche conditions. It was quite an eye opening experience that leaves me looking at the snow in a completely new and more respectful way."/>
