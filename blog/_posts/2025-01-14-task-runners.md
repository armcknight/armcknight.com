I was recently talking task runners with some folks, which covered `make`, `rake` and a new one to me: [`sake`](https://github.com/kattouf/Sake), a task runner implemented in Swift. This got me thinking about names for some other task runners that could be written in other languages:

- bake: brainfuck
- cake: cobol
- fake: fortran
- flake: franz lisp
- jake: javascript
- lake:  lolcode
- quake: a first-person-shooter-based task runner
- take: TeX
- wake: a WYSIWYG graphical task runner

Shout out to [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just), a task runner written in Rust, which I found while researching this subject, because I like the name so much.
