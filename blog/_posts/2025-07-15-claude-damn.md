You may not have heard of it, but there is a new frontier afoot in programming. No, not declarative UI. Not machine learning. Not LLMs, prompt or context engineering.

Vibe coding?

Well, I've been using Cursor and Claude for the past year or so, and GitHub copilot a bit before that, as well as plain ol' ChatGPT. It's been pretty obvious since the get-go that these technologies are nothing short of transformational. They're disrupting art, school, and of course engineering.

I've of course shown many friends the ChatGPT iOS app in voice mode, and we've all had a good bit of fun with it, and then waxed philosophical afterwards with comparisons to _Her_.

Some of my previous big wins using LLMs–aside from just sitting there staring at the screen while I hit &lt;TAB&gt; and things very closely resembling what I'm thinking magically appear on the screen–were translating a couple side projects I had built as Python scripts into a language I like a bit more: Swift. This, they handled with aplomb.

Now, I've turned to rebuilding my website, which I've hand tweaked for years but never really been happy with. I am admittedly not a very good designer. With probably 8 hours of vibe prompting, and just a sprinkle of hand editing, I was able to produce something much more pleasing to my eye (and I hope yours too). And, I finally knocked out some long-standing TODOs: my last site only had a blog and links page, with the rest "under construction," seemingly in perpetuity. Now I finally have projects and experience pages in a form I've long dreamt about.

Behold the difference:

<table>
	<tr>
		<td style="border:0px">
{% include 
	blog-post-image.html 
	source="website-redesign-before.png" 
	alt="drake dislike dot jpg" %}
		</td>
		<td style="border:0px">
{% include 
	blog-post-image.html 
	source="website-redesign-after.png" 
	alt="drake like dot jpg" %}
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>
