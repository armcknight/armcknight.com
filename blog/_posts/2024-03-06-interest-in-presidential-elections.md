No, no, this isn't a post talking about voter turnout or apathy...

I saw a question about whether interest rates will go down this year or not, and realizing it's a US presidential election year, I wondered if it could be a politically motivated thing. Then I wondered what the history of rate changes in election years looks like: what was the change in the rate, who the chairman was that year and who appointed them, to see if there might be any political bent to it. Voil√°!

Looks like a pretty mixed bag to me. The biggest complicating factor is that most chairmen were appointed and then sustained by presidents across the political divide. There doesn't seem to be a pattern of economic manipulation against unfavorable political candidates. I'm also too young to have all the context of each of these elections; the first one I was old enough to vote in was 2004.
