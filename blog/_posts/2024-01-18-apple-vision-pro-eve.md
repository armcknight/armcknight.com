I've had this in a draft for a couple months, and seeing as how it's the eve of preorders for the Apple Vision Pro, it seemed like the perfect time to ship it B)

Saw a link for a new product: [https://solreader.com/](https://solreader.com/) and it inspired me to plan my days around targeted VR products:

10pm - 6am: I wear my Serta® Sweet Dreamz™ sleep mask wearable that projects photos from my phone onto my eyelids.

6am-7am: wear my Strava® Strainors™ while on my treadmill/peloton/erg so I see the beautiful scenery passing by while sweating in my room.

7am-730am: wear my Kellogg's® See-real™ while I eat breakfast. Nobody knows why they made this.

730am-9am: commute to work. The NTSB has prevented Ford®'s TunnelVision™ driving wearable from entering the market, but dear god I hope they reverse course soon because the real world is so _bland_.

9am-5pm: wear my Apple® VisionPro™ at work. Nobody knows I'm actually playing CS:GO and surfing Reddit half the day.

5pm-630pm: another boring commute home.

630pm-730pm: wear my Calphalon® Teflon-coated Look What's Cookin'™ glasses sponsored by Guy Fieri (there's also a Rachel Ray version) while I eat dinner. They make what you cook look 20% more edible!

730pm-830pm: Meta® Oculus™ gaming time.

830pm-10pm: Binge a couple episodes on my Netflix® All the World's a Stage™ headset.

10pm: back to some more Sweet Dreamz™...
