ðŸŽµ And you may find yourself inconsistently tracking UIViewController lifecycle changes

And you may find yourself making an innocuous change to some ObjC

And you may find yourself unwinding a bowl full of spaghetti swizzling macros

And you may find yourself debugging pthread_mutex_lock synchronization

And you may ask yourself well, "How did I get here?" ðŸŽ¶
