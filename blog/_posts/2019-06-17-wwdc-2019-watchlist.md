For all those lucky enough to attend WWDC this year, congrats and hope your first week back in the real world went well! It's been a few years since I've been, myself, but I always enjoy watching the session videos produced. I've already started watching as many as I could squeeze in last two weeks, but there are many more I hope to catch.

I've categorized them beyond the tracks Apple defines, like Developer Tools or Frameworks. Hopefully, this helps me pick which one to view next, and achieve a little temporal locality by watching all videos about a particular topic all at once.

Here are the categories... click each to go to the list of sessions. The sessions are mostly in the order that I'll watch them within each category, which is not simply a sequential ordering of the numbers Apple gives them.
