Code review is a common practice in software engineering, for a variety of good reasons. Now, for every comment on a PR, you might ask: "does the reviewer require the requested change before they will approve?" Levels Of Giving A Fuck, aka LOGAF[^8], attempts to assign importance to each piece of feedback, usually with three levels: low, medium or high (condolences to anyone dealing with more than that![^9]). GitHub tries to solve this problem by giving reviewers top-level review options to "Approve" or "Request Changes"... oh, and a third option, "Comment", which some teams will opt to use as a "soft rejection" implied by the absence of approval. When did we become so afraid of decisive action?

# Pick a lane

The law of the excluded middle states that something is either true or it isn't–there is no third option. So, for each comment, the reviewer either requires the change, or doesn't. Adding more levels adds more cognitive overhead and process, and introduces more possibility for disagreement and misunderstanding, because everyone's LOGAF thresholds will be calibrated differently. The same person's thresholds may even change over time! (This is known as ratings distinction[^1].) In the most pathological cases, the middle ground can be used as part of a motte-and-bailey strategy where a protracted debate can ensue without accountability, since the reviewer can always say "well, it's not a high LOGAF, so it's fine to punt on this."

OK, well, if it's fine to punt on it, maybe don't comment in the first place and burn a bunch of time for multiple people to hash it out. And then also, refrain from commenting any "lows". Just give me the things you need changed so we can all move on with our work. Leave the rest of the crap for the lunch table or slack channel bikeshed of the day. Or a DM; in the spirit of "praise in public and critique in private", I propose: "propose in public, bikeshed in backchannels". You can also always do it yourself later! I'll approve it–IDGAF! Just stop wasting my time discussing theoretical, unnecessary work, and just spend a smaller amount of time to do it the way you want it done. Because if you want something done right...

# Rate this

Much ink has been spilled on the efficacy of ratings systems like 5-star systems[^2][^3] used by Amazon, Netflix, Uber and countless others, or tripartite classifications like eBay's positive/neutral/negative feedback system. But some of these organizations realized that most feedback actually tended towards a bimodal distribution[^6] rendering the 5-star system confusing and meaningless[^7] and decided to change to a simple thumbs up/down system[^4][^5]. One study showed that, ironically, a 5-star rating wasn't even the best rating; rather, the "best" according to people consulting reviews would fall in the range [4.2, 4.5][^10]. I seem to remember, but can no longer find, an article talking about how the range [4.5, 5.0] is essentially a projection of [1, 5]. This one[^11] is pretty close though, which mentions the "7 to 9" scale when using a 1-10 rating system.

# Simplify!

Some products decide to use a 4 part scale instead of a five part scale, to exclude the neutral option. Now, you're forced to make a choice for or against! Just that, you can indicate how strongly you feel about your choice. But this still runs into the problem of ratings discrimination: everyone will have different strength thresholds. So I say, just collapse "somewhat care" and "strongly care" into just "required", and "somewhat irrelevant" and "extremely irrelevant" into just "irrelevant". Then, instead of leaving irrelevant comments on a PR, go write them in your journal, blog etc.
