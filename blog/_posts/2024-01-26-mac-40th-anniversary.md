People are writing their memories about their formative memories with Apple's Macintosh computers in celebration of [40 years](https://mac40th.com) of their development. These are my own.

# Earliest Memories

It must have been 1st grade for me, so 1991-92, when I saw and used my first Macintosh. I honestly don't remember what we even did with it, but I remember the 5.25" floppy disks that the programs we used came on. I assume we were playing some kind of learning games.

I also remember using MacPaint, but can't exactly remember which model, in 2nd grade, so 1992-93, if memory serves.

In high school, I took a journalism class, and saw the iconic color iMacs they were outfitted with. But I never got to play with one.

I think a cousin of mine also had one of those iMacs that I briefly played with once. The mouse struck me as so alien.

Everything after that happened on Windows computers. I remember windows 3.2, 95, 98, ME, 2000, on various family computers. These were the machines on which I cut my coding teeth, learning my way through DOS in the command prompt (aside from some hobby hacking on a TI-83 calculator). I bought my first computer for myself at 19, a Dell Latitude, running Windows XP.

Around the same time, a buddy enrolled in a school for sound engineers, and asked what kind of computer he should get. Based on what I knew at the time about creatives using Macs and the longevity and how they retain resale value, that's what I recommended, and he got a Macbook. Some time later we'd become roommates, and I remember how strange it felt trying to navigate Finder with the trackpad that scrolled in the wrong direction! (And he had the same experience with my laptop.)

# First Purchase

Fast forward a few years, and I'm in university, with a more recently purchased [Sony VIAO 17"](https://www.cnet.com/reviews/sony-vaio-e-series-17-inch-review/), an absolute behemoth. It ran Windows Vista. I actually took it backpacking in Europe for 6 weeks, ow, my back. But it did get us out of a bind a few times. This was before we could afford smartphones, so that was our only connection to the internet.

Two things happened one or two semesters in. One, I finally had enough of the bulk of the hulk. And two, I wanted something closer to a Unix experience. (OK, and three, the VIAO had already started falling apart, and coupled with my memory of the Latitude before it frying a motherboard only maybe a year in, I wanted to get in on this legendary longevity I'd heard so much about). So I bought a 13" Macbook Air in 2012.

And wow, that thing blew my hair back. After a short ramp up period with the new UI paradigms, I felt way, way faster working in both GUIs and the terminal. I learned more and more keyboard shortcuts that seemed to make more sense to me (and I'm pleased to say I _still_ learn new shortcuts today-as a touch typist this really helps me work faster and faster).

The portability and slickness of the device was unlike anything I'd ever experienced, and even in that smaller form factor it still felt faster than the VIAO in compute.

Soon after I got into iOS development. Some time while still with the VIAO I had bought a Droid X2, but in the summer of 2012 I think it was, I bought my wife and I both an iPhone 4. Soon after I started contracting in my free time (hah!) from school to develop iOS apps. The way devices and the software running on them worked together left my Windows and Android devices in the dust; I had spent endless hours fiddling to get things working, and the quality never compared. The amount of time I got back to actually do what I wanted to do was priceles, as I value time higher than anything else.

# Where I am Today

That was 12 years ago, and I've been developing for iOS and Mac ever since. I've consulted and contracted developing iOS apps and more, and for the last 6ish years, have worked on tools for other iOS developers. Working in the SDK world and on the low level domains I've been involved with, like crash reporting and performance profiling, have brought me deeper and deeper into wondrous realms of computing that I could only dream of creating on my own.

The depth and richness of software development at Apple, aside from their stellar hardware production of both whole computers and more recently microprocessors and SoCs, is really something to behold. I've got copies of [Mac OS X Internals](https://www.amazon.com/Mac-OS-Internals-Approach-paperback/dp/0134426541), an absolute unit of a tome rivaling that old VIAO, which I assume will take the rest of my natural born life to get through, that shows just how deep the rabbit hole goes.

I still remember the magic of creating my first iOS UI in a XIB in Xcode, and dragging a connection from a button to code to create a method to run when it was clicked. Moments like that come few and far between in the day to day drudgery of software development. It felt similar to the first time I worked in Flash Studio, and before that, Microsoft Visual Studio with C# connected to a GUI builder, and before that, Dreamweaver and FrontPage Express. I've gone back and forth several times on WYSIWYG editing, but it's undeniably a springboard into getting things done. It's certainly sexier than reading manpages and building CLI pipelines, even though that's still where I prefer to live these days, with the power of scripting and ever more abstraction (and I still prefer to build GUIs all in code, too).

It's been quite the journey, and there's so much more I'd love to do. The ecosystem including Apple TV and Watch, and now Vision Pro (despite my conservative outlook on it) bring a ton of interesting possibilities. It's fun work, and there's no doubt that it put me on a life track unimaginable to me back in 1st and 2nd grade, not to mention the turmoil of my early 20s.

Here's to the next 40!
