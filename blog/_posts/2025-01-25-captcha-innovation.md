In order to verify you're human, you'll be asked to solve a simple puzzle, selected at random from leetcode medium. Once we receive your solution, one of our engineers will review your submission and get in touch with you in 2-4 weeks, where we'll schedule your onsite interview. We like to move quickly, so we do it all in one day: 2 to 3 rounds of technical sessions, consisting of pair programming and whiteboard systems design, followed by a culture fit interview with a PM, EM and HR associate, and finally a quick chat with the CEO. If you're the rockstar we're looking for, you should expect an offer to log into your account within one week.
