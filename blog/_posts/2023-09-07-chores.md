_an unknown local number is calling..._

"Mr. Andrew McKnight?"

"speaking"

"Hello, this is Sgt. Paul Orky with Prince William County Police, we have your daughter here. We received a report that someone was... chainsawing a utility pole behind the 7-eleven on Hoadly Rd near Dale Blvd. The dispatched officers apprehended her, wearing earmuffs and ski goggles, struggling to get the blade free after the pole collapsed over the cut and bound it. The wires were the only thing supporting the weight, she's lucky it didn't fall on her or any cars passing by. The utility company is there now making emergency repairs. I think you'd better come down here so we can discuss charges."

"charges? i've seen those lines, they can't be any more than 50 kilovolts"

"Excuse me?"

_...she remembered her eyes and ears..._

"Sir, please, just come on down to the station..."

_...we didn't even own a chainsaw..._
