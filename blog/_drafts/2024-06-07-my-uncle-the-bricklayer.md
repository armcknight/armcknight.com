I was thinking about something that should've been included in my earlier [post
for Mac's 40th](/2024/06/06/mac-40th-anniversary/), but slipped my mind. There
are a couple reasons why my uncle pops up in mind mind with some frequecy, as he did
today, even though he died many years ago.

One is when I'm doing some labor intensive chore or
DIY project around the house. When I was 16 I spent just a week or two in the summer
working with him doing masonry, and to this day it's still the hardest work I've ever experienced. I
didn't even make the drive home each day without falling asleep (don't worry,
he was driving). He was on a
project building a chimney on a new house, and were hauling 100+ pound sections of flu up 2
stories, plus attic height, in addition to the usual carrying bricks back
and forth, and mixing and moving mortar in a wheelbarrow.

I remember him working with such a good attitude; he enjoyed it. I would go on to work in hot and stressful kitchens
for several years, so am aware of what extended periods of hard work are like,
but still, his example always comes back to me when I think I'm fed up with
software work. I'm very aware of the cushy lifestyle I'd be giving up. I know
just how much harder an income can be to come by. And I know how an
easygoing attitude can make things seem a little less insufferable.

He was obsessed with optimizing his, as we'd call it in the kitchen, mise en
place. He was always trying to find the "lazy" way to do things. But he paid
attention to detail and cared about quality. These are things I still strive
for today when programming.

Which leads me to the other reason I think of him often: he was always interested in
science and computers. He was the first by far to make his own greeting cards
with a printer at home. He always played interesting PC games like Myst and
Descent. And of course, tons of Minesweeper, Solitaire, Freecell and Hearts. He
often talked about theoretical physics type stuff.

He told a story once about a computer virus he heard about that would cause the
hard disk read head to extend down enough to contact the spinning platter, ruining
whatever data existed at that position. This was decades before the world heard
about a similar thing in Stuxnet, a software virus that could cause damage to hardware. I definitely thought about him then.

He grew up or at least lived in California, driving up and down the coast to
find the good surf. Pissing in the radiator of their jalopy on the side of a
desert road. Living a fulfilling hippy lifestyle. 

I think about that a lot, too, when I think about where life has taken me, what
I do with my time, and what feels fulfilling to me. I'm glad to have had a
little bit of his influence.

Thanks, Uncle Don. I hope you're getting good rest.
