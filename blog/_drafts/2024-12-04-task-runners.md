I recently was talking task runners with some folks, which mentioned `make`, `rake` and a new one to me: [`sake`](https://github.com/kattouf/Sake). That got me thinking about names for some other task runners that could be written for other languages:
- bake: brainfuck
- cake: c, cobol, rust (c for cargo since rake is already taken)
- fake: fortran
- flake: franz lisp
- jake: javascript
- lake: lua, lolcode
- quake: a first-person shooter task runner
- take: TeX
- wake: a WYSIWYG graphical task runner

Shout out to [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just), another nice name pun, which is a task runner written in Rust.
