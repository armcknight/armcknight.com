The RFC is my guidance; I SHALL NOT torrent.
<br />
I accept all cookies; I subscribe to newsletters for updates.
<br />
I restoreth my backups.
<br />
Peers review my performance for my managers' sake.
<br />
Yea, though I wage war on social media over the question de jure, I will fear no troll; for thou retweet me.
<br />
Thy bots and riffraff, they upvote me.
<br />
Thou preparest a vtable before me, in protected heap memory.
<br />
Thou `git reset HEAD~1` and `stash --all`.
<br />
My stack runneth over.
<br />
Surely good reviews and 5 stars will follow all my releases, and I will sell programs for $0.99 in the app store forever.
