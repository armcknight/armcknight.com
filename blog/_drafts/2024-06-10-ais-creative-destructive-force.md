One of the biggest questions about AI is one of ethics: is it going to replace the humans that have pioneered the fields it's moving in?

So often when humans create a new technology to solve a problem better/faster, we wind up discovering more of that kind or a new kind of problem to solve; like tearing muscle fibers to build new muscle, creative destruction often leads to proliferation.
