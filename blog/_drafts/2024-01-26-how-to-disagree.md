Three steps I want to try when disagreeing and trying to bring people around to my way of thinking: respond, maybe reiterate and maybe... juuust maybe... relent.

# Respond

“If you don't ask, you don't get it.” - Mahatma Ghandhi

You should always feel free to offer a response with a different point of view. Do it with respect, compassion and charity.

# Reiterate?

'I cannot tell you how much I hate to reiterate something, especially when I have already iterated it." - Percival Cox, Scrubs

Yes, it can feel painful and nearly condescending to restate what you've already said. But check out the definition of the word according to the Oxford dictionary:

"say something again or a number of times, typically for emphasis or clarity"

That last part is crucial. You don't just parrot what you've already said, but you clarify it and approach it from a slightly different angle or more circumspectly. Oftentimes, the followups to your response will contain new information, which may give you a foothold to strengthening your own argument.

It's also important to remember that this step is optional. You may find that a reasonable counterargument has been made that means you are actually wrong, or a good compromise is immediately offered, or even that someone with the appropriate authority simply says "no."

# Relent?

If at this point, you've stated your case as clearly as you can with all the information available, and you're not making any progress, it may be time to at least accept a compromise, or simply let the issue go altogether.

Remember that this may be the next step right after an initial response.
